# Header one

## Header two

### Header three

I can also type things in here normally.

 * Bullet item 1
 * Bullet item 2
 * Another thing
 
1. another list item
1. Numbered lists
5. this is the final one

It's probably *good* to know that _things_ you **expect** to work **will** ~~not~~ work.

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(1)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = "hello there"
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(a)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
a = "hi there"
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
print(a)
```
